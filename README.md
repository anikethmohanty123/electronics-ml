#Electronics ML — Predicting Ratings & Popularity of Amazon Products
## End to End Machine Learning Project | Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

### Overview:

This project builds a full end-to-end machine learning system that predicts:
1. Product Rating (Regression)
- Predicts the Amazon rating of an electronics product using:
- Product name
- Price
- Review count
- Stock availability
- 
2. Product Popularity (Classification)
- Classifies whether a product is popular based on review volume (top 25% of products).
- The system includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Regression & classification model
- Evaluation metrics
- Prediction CLI
- Visualizations with Matplotlib
- Clean and scalable project structure

Visualizations (Matplotlib)

The project generates several exploratory visualizations:

Price Distribution
